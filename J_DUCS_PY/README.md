## Functions

### `clone_or_update_repo()`

Clones the repository if it doesn't exist locally or updates it if it already exists.

### `read_json()`

Reads a JSON file and returns the loaded data.

### `format_message(role)`

Generates a formatted message for a new internship posting, including details such as company name, role title, location, season, sponsorship, and posting date.

### `check_for_new_roles()`

Checks for new roles, compares them with previous data, and sends messages for new visible and active roles.

### `send_message(message, channel_id)`

### `on_ready()`

Prints a message when the bot is logged in and then continuously runs a schedule while sleeping for 1 second in between.

## Scheduling

The bot uses the `schedule` library to check for new roles every minute. This can be adjusted by modifying the scheduling interval in the `mainbot.py` file.
